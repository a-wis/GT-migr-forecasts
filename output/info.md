# Contents of the folder

The folder contains outputs of the analysis (with analysis.R). File `results_all.RData` contains simulations for all models and years for which forecasts were made. Other files include outputs for specific models:

- `results_30.RData`: models with data starting 2013
- `results_31.RData`: models with data starting 2012
- `results_32.RData`: models with data starting 2013 but using differences, not levels
